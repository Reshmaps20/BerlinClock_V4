## About this Kata
This short and simple Kata should be performed using Test Driven Development (TDD).
## Rules
The Berlin Clock (Mengenlehreclock or Berlin Uhr) is a clock that tells the time using a series of illuminated coloured blocks, as you can see in the picture for this project.

- The **top lamp** blinks to show **seconds**; it is illuminated on **even seconds** and off on **odd seconds**.

- The next two rows represent **hours**:
    - The **upper row** represents **5-hour blocks** and is made up of **4 red lamps**.
    - The **lower row** represents **1-hour blocks** and is also made up of **4 red lamps**.

- The final two rows represent **minutes**:
    - The **upper row** represents **5-minute blocks** and is made up of **11 lamps**â€”every third lamp is **red**, while the rest are **yellow**.
    - The **bottom row** represents **1-minute blocks** and is made up of **4 yellow lamps**.

## Requirements

- **Java** : 1.8
- **Springboot** : 2.7
- **Maven** : For Dependency management
- **JUnit** : 5.x

## How to Build the Application

- Clone this repository:
   ```bash
